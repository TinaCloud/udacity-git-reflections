Lesson 2 Reflections:

What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	It adds a hidden '.git' directory, but doesn't do an initial commit (you must specify all commits, even first one)
	inside .git directory, there is a bunch of infrastructure to keep track of the repository history
	Here's the documentation site for more info:
	http://git-scm.com/docs/git-init
	You need to do it because this is what sets up the infrastructure to support the repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?  What do you think it offers?
	The staging area stores what items in your working directory you want to put into the repository during the next commit.
	It offers you the control over your commits so that the changes saved are only the ones that are grouped into that logical change
